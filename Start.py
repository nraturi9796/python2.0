#what is pyhton
# python is high level programming language ,
# which is used in AI,Data Analyst,game,application;

#features of pyhton
# 1:high level langauage
# 2:simple and easy Syntax
# 3:interpretted
# 4:Dynamic in nature
# 6:open source
# 7:OOPS
# 8:Big library function
# 9:plateform independent

# first code of python
# print("hello python")

# variable->variable are the name which are given the values.
# Values->Values are content which is store in a variable.
#EX->
# name="Anjali"
# age=23
# print("name is:",name)
# print("age is:",age)
#  so name is "variable" and Anjali is "Value"
#identifiers->identifiers are combination of uppercase & lowercase letter,digit
# we can not use % @ in this type of word in case of variable.
# An idendifier are not start from digit Ex: 1age×
#age4√ valid identifier

#how to cheack type of variable->
# name="Nitesh"
# age=23
# RoomNo=45.5
# print(type(name))
# print(type(age))
# print(type(RoomNo))

#Data Type
#Integer->include this values + - and 0 in int we can not write -5.55 but we can write -5
# String-> We can write world with in string.Like "Hello","Anjali" "Nitesh".
#we can write string in single quote like"hello",and double quote''hello'',and tripale quote'''hello'''
#Examle->
# name1="AR"
# name2='NR'
# name3='''NR'''
# print(name1)
# print(name2)
# print(name3)

# python is case sensitive language
#  sum of two number
# a=42
# b=45
# sum=a+b
# print(sum)

# Operator 
# An operator is symbol that perform certain operation in between operand

# Python divides the operators in the following groups:

# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment operators
# Comparison operators
# Logical operators
# Identity operators
# Membership operators
# Bitwise operators

# Arithmetic operators(+,-,/,*,%,**)
# a=45;
# b=5;
# print(a+b)
# print(a-b)
# print(a/b)
# print(a*b)
# print(a%b)
# print(a**b)

# Comparison operators
# Operator	Name	Example	Try it
# ==	Equal	x == y	
# !=	Not equal	x != y	
# >	Greater than	x > y	
# <	Less than	x < y	
# >=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
# <=	Less than or equal to	x <= y

# a=45;
# b=54;
# print(a==b)
# print(a!=b)
# print(a>b)
# print(a<b)
# print(a<=b)
# print(a>=b)

# Python Assignment Operators
# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables
# =	x = 5	x = 5	
# +=	x += 3	x = x + 3	
# -=	x -= 3	x = x - 3	
# *=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	
# /=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	
# %=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	
# //=	x //= 3	x = x // 3	
# **=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3	
# &=	x &= 3	x = x & 3	
# |=	x |= 3	x = x | 3	
# ^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	
# >>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	
# <<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3	
# # :=	print(x := 3)	x = 3
# # print(x)
# a=34
# a +=9
# print(a)
# a=34
# a -=9
# print(a)
# a=34
# a *=9
# print(a)
# a=34
# a /=9
# print(a)
# a=34
# a %=9
# print(a)
